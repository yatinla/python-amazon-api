python-amazon-api: python module for Amazon's Product Advertising API
=====================================================================

Why another? I only tried one other but it needed some xml library I 
didn't have and when I tried to install that using pip install in my 
virtualenv python sandbox it wouldn't build so I decided to write 
my own and make it depend only on standard Python libraries.
This is a fork of the pyflix2 library from amalakar's github
repository.  Thanks to those who have contributed for all
the work.
