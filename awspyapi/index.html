Made just after Lady And The Tramp and Sleeping Beauty, and with The Jungle Book not far away, it was a rich time for Disney, and fans of animated movies.
101 Dalmatians is simply wonderful in its own right, though. In Cruella De Vil, Disney put on screen one of its finest ever villains, and its charming collection of characters are a joy to spend time with.

There's lot to enjoy on the disc, and as always, Disney has provided something for all ages of viewers. The making-of piece in particular is of interest, given that it brings modern-day Disney talent together to look back at what makes the film so special. Unsurprisingly, Cruella gets a special feature all of her own, too. But if you're looking for an archive treat, the correspondence between Walt Disney and the book's author, Dodie Smith is just lovely.

Finally, there's the film itself, cleaned up and looking utterly pristine in 1080p, with a sparkling audio mix accompanying it. It's incredible that a film made so many decades ago maintains such a spring in its step, and it's with good reason that 101 Dalmatians remains one of the most popular, and best, movies that Walt Disney Studios has every produced. --Jon Foster</p></body></html>
