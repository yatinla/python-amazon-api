Description: python-amazon-api: python module for Amazon's Product Advertising API
        =====================================================================
        
        Why another? I only tried one other but it needed some xml library I 
        didn't have and when I tried to install that using pip install in my 
        virtualenv python sandbox it wouldn't build so I decided to write 
        my own and make it depend only on standard Python libraries.
        This is a fork of the pyflix2 library from amalakar's github
        repository.  Thanks to those who have contributed for all
        the work.

        History
        -------
        
        
        0.5.4 (2013-02-24)
        +++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Add get_amazon_review which is better, if it exists, than the
          product description I think.
        
        0.5.3 (2013-02-23)
        +++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Add get_product_description method to get the ProductDescription
          for an item.  Also required adding EditorialReview to the 
          response groups.  
        
        - Also fixed main so that it propertly sets the html meta type to
          utf-8 in the <head> of the little HTML demo page it creates
          since the product description is in utf-8
        
        0.5.2 (2013-02-23)
        +++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Minor fix to the main in aws_search.py so that it opens
          the aws.xml file in unicode mode because it was sometimes
          crashing otherwise when trying to write out xml with writexml
          that had unicode chars.
        
        0.5.1 (2013-02-22)
        +++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Add several functions like get_title and get_page_count.  But there
          are a few cases where I need to add the capability to get an actual
          XML attribute (not AWS Attribute) from a tag such as the Creator
          attribute has a Role attribute.
        
        0.5.0 (2013-02-22)
        +++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Realized that it is silly not to use the ASIN and save it in the database.
          I want a specific Item not just whatever is returned by each search.
          So changed AwsSearch so that now it can take an ASIN which of course
          kind of makes the name wrong but oh well for now it'll do.  And it
          doesn't have to take the ASIN.  I can do a search first and then
          pick and item and get the ASIN
        
        0.4.2 (2013-02-21)
        +++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Well, found more problems and realized that not having
          the option of an inexact match by attributes is just
          too restrictive especially for movies where Amazon
          considers the title as something like 
          "Blade Runner Collector's 25th Anniversary Edition"
          or whatever.
          
        0.4.1 (2013-02-21)
        +++++++++++++++++++
        
        - The AwsSearch construction would overwrite the callers
          search parameters with the list of all possible ones
        
        - Remove accidental second version of get_item_bindings
        
        - get_items_by_attributes really didn't work correctly at
          all.  Now it only returns the items that have Attributes
          with values that match all of those in the input dictionary.
          It is permissable for an item to havem multiple attributes
          with the same tag such as Actor and not all of them have
          to match but at least one has to match the desired value.
          This seems like the sensible thing for movie searches
          since they do have multiple Actor tags in the Attributes.
          
        
        0.4.0 (2013-02-19)
        +++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Adding new functionality to return attributes
          like Author, RunningTime, and such.
        
          Removed more debugging prints
        
        0.3.1 (2013-02-03)
        +++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Remove debugging prints
        
        0.3.0 (2013-02-03)
        +++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Superbowl Sunday!! Signifant refactoring not
          necessarily backward compatible.  Add the ability
          to search for items by attributes and get all available
          bindings and specify a particular item when looking for
          the image URL or the DetailsPageURL.
        
        0.2.1 (2013-02-02)
        +++++++++++++++++++
        
        - If run as main it now creates a simple HTML page to open
          in a browser with the medium image for the search result and
          it is clickable and goes to the main product page for the result
        
        0.1.1 (2013-02-02)
        +++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Add aws_search.py with the AwsSearch class and also rename
          the module to awspyapi
        
        0.1.0 (2012-12-20)
        +++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Initial version
