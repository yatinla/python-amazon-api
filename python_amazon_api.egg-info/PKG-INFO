        =====================================================================
        
        Why another? I only tried one other but it needed some xml library I 
        didn't have and when I tried to install that using pip install in my 
        virtualenv python sandbox it wouldn't build so I decided to write 
        my own and make it depend only on standard Python libraries.
        This is a fork of the pyflix2 library from amalakar's github
        repository.  Thanks to those who have contributed for all
        the work.
